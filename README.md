# Namdm

Official implementation of the neural architecture search framework presented in:  **"Novel Neural Network Automation Design Method for Energy Saving and Carbon Emission Reducing of Petrochemical Production Processes"**

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Industrial-Grade NAS** - Automated neural architecture search optimized for petrochemical process modeling
- **Energy-Carbon Dual Optimization** - Integrated energy efficiency and carbon footprint evaluation metrics
- **Production-Ready** - Validated on real-world ethylene cracking furnace data



## üìúAlphaMixLoss

The script named "run.py" is tasked with implementing the alphaMixLoss, a brand - new hybrid loss function put forward in the previously mentioned paper. The form of the alphaMixLoss loss function is governed by the hyperparameter Œ±, and the value of this hyperparameter Œ± can be ascertained via the Bayesian optimization algorithm. Through the learning process of the hyperparameter Œ±, a balance is struck between the penalty intensity for outliers and the performance decline that results from the amplification of outliers (specifically, outliers greater than one).

## üîñNamdm

The proposed Namdm follows these principal steps:
Step 1: Gather the real - world production dataset. Then, classify it into a training set and a test set, which will serve as the input for the neural network.
Step 2: Formulate the loss function MixLoss as presented in the following equation. This function is designed to strike a balance between the penalty intensity for outliers and the performance deterioration issue of the Namdm. Additionally, optimize the number of hidden - layer nodes, the iteration count, the batch size, and the parameter Œ± in the Œ±MixLoss loss function. The aim is to reach the global optimum of the Namdm.
Œ±MixLoss=Œ±‚ãÖMSE+(1‚àíŒ±)‚ãÖLog_Cosh
Step 3: Employ the Namdm approach to optimize various neural networks. Subsequently, compare it with pre - existing optimization techniques. The evaluation is carried out using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and time as criteria, with the goal of validating the superiority of this automatic - modeling optimization method.
Step 4: Evaluate and analyze the outcomes. The insights obtained will offer technical direction for the actual production process.
